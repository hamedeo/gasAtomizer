# CURRENT STATE:

	+ The level of distortion (y) is now being printed as "Level of distortion" by including myDistortedSphereDrag in lagrangian/intermediate

# CURRENT ISSUES:

#/*/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////*/
#/*---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/
#/******************         Level Of Distortion         ****************************************/
#/*---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/
#/*---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

	1. The value of y is consistently equal to zero, as we expected.
	2. The initialization of myDistortedSphereDrag begins after the last droplet is introduced!
	3. Funny is that the "Level of distorion y" wont get printed into console (or openfoam doesnt read it) while using 4 processors to run sprayFoam!!!
 
#  CURRENT MEASUREMENTS

	1. Trying to use DebugSwitch 
	2. Tracking the code to understand how OpenFOAM utilizes the distortedSphereDrag functionality.
	3. I removed openfoam and installed it again but that was not an issue.
