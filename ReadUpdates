# CURRENT STATE:

	+ The level of distortion (y) is now being printed as "Level of distortion" by including myDistortedSphereDrag in lagrangian/intermediate
	+ y Level of distortion is works fine with TAB model and basically the original models of openFOAM installation

# CURRENT ISSUES:

#/*/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////*/
#/*---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/
#/******************      Level Of Distortion for KH of local file      *************************/
#/*---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/
#/*---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

	1. Happens only for *KelvinHelmholtz* of our local files. The value of y is consistently equal to zero, as we expected.
	2. Happens For all BreakUp models : myDistortedSphereDrag is calculated only for some processors (with 2 or 4 processors --> only for last introduced droplet) 
 
#  CURRENT MEASUREMENTS

	1. The problem arises by using our home Breakup Model KelvinHelmholtz so will compare them together to see what is missing.
	2. Tracking the code to understand how OpenFOAM utilizes the Drag Force & Breakup Model to update y while running in parallel. First guess would be setup of our decomposeParDict file has some issues.
